# Task 1: Create a vector named car_speed.
Speed1 = c(32.48, 33.59, 57.00, 58.45, 58.83, 59.31, 60.28, 62.40, 62.71, 63.39, 64.26, 66.87, 70.26, 70.64, 73.43, 74.91, 76.69, 76.85, 77.07, 77.33) 

# Task 2: Obtain and present the average speed

meanSpeed1 = mean(Speed1)
print(paste("The mean of speed1 is", round(meanSpeed1, 2), "miles per hour"))

# Task 3: Obtain and present the median speed

medianSpeed1 = median(Speed1)
print(paste("The median of speed1 is", round(medianSpeed1, 2), "miles per hour"))

# Task 4: Obtain and present the standard deviation

sdSpeed1 = sd(Speed1)
print(paste("The standard deviation of speed1 is", round(sdSpeed1, 2)))

# Task 5: Obtain and present quantiles

quantile0=quantile(Speed1, probs = c (0))
quantile1=quantile(Speed1, probs = c (0.25))
quantile2=quantile(Speed1, probs = c (0.5))
quantile3=quantile(Speed1, probs = c (0.75))
quantile4=quantile(Speed1, probs = c (1))

print(paste("The 0th quantile, also called the minimum value is ", quantile0))

print(paste("The 50th quantile is",quantile2))
print(paste("The 75th quantile is",quantile3))
print(paste("The 100th quantile, also called the maximum value is",quantile4))

# Task 6: Delete values. 

Speed2 = Speed1[! Speed1 %in% c(32.48)]
meanSpeed2 = mean(Speed2)
medianSpeed2 = median(Speed2)
sdSpeed2 = sd(Speed2)

# Task 7: Add values.

Speed3 = c(Speed2,98.21 )
meanSpeed3 = mean(Speed3)
medianSpeed3 = median(Speed3)
sdSpeed3 = sd(Speed3)

# Task 8. Use vectors to store and organize objects

vectorSpeed1 = c(meanSpeed1, medianSpeed1, sdSpeed1)
vectorSpeed2 = c(meanSpeed2, medianSpeed2, sdSpeed2)
vectorSpeed3 = c(meanSpeed3, medianSpeed3, sdSpeed3)

Speed_Table = matrix(c(vectorSpeed1, vectorSpeed2, vectorSpeed3), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

Speed_Table_Rounded = round(Speed_Table, 2)

colnames (Speed_Table_Rounded) = c("Mean", "Median", "StDev")
rownames (Speed_Table_Rounded) = c("Speed1", "Speed2", "Speed3")

# Task 9. Present the values using a table 

# Note: Use R markdown to view the below results
knitr:::kable(Speed_Table,
              align = "c", 
              digits = 2,
              format = "html",
              table.attr = "style='width:40%;'")

# Task 10: Using Speed 3, present all values above 70

Speed3_gt70 = subset(Speed3, Speed3>70)

# Task 11: Sum values that are higher than 70.

SumOfSpeed_gt70 = sum(Speed3_gt70)

# Task 12: Sum values that are lower 70

Speed3_lt70 = subset(Speed3, Speed3<70)
SumOfSpeed_lt70 = sum(Speed3_lt70)

# Task 13. Duplicate the following table using R codes

Jan = c(25000, 15872, 22084)
Feb = c(27432, 19734, 18340)
Mar = c(32684, 23871, 21439)

Revenue_Table = matrix(c(Jan, Feb, Mar), nrow = 3, byrow = TRUE)

colnames (Revenue_Table) = c("Bogota", "Caracas", "Buenos Aires")
rownames (Revenue_Table) = c("January", "February", "March")

# Task 14. Write a summary of your project 1

# After working on this project, Below are skills that I have learned and improved upon
# 1. Problem Solving Capability: I have learned to tackle the problem more logically
# 2. Attention to Detail: Paying attention to details is necessary, because one mistake in syntax or logic,  could hamper your results
# 3. Patience: We need a lot a patience, because when I was coding, I have written some code. I was extremely confident in it. I double and triple checked it, and it wasnâ€™t working properly. Then, I have to go back again and view the code from start.
# 4. Debugging Skills: I have improved my debugging skills by trying to find root cause, whenever code was getting struck and wasn't giving expected results.
